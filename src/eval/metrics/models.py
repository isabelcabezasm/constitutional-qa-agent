    outcome measurement scenarios.

    Attributes:

            or cause, typically related to habits, activities, or input factors.
        consequence_variable (str): The name of the variable that represents
            the outcome or effect, typically related to results, effects, or
            output measures.
    Example: Tobacco use significantly increases mortality risk.
